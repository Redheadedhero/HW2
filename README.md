Homework 2
Part A I added a terrain slider where it starts with the mirror and heightmap plane intersecting then seperating but jointed at the noise.
Part B I changed the activity and behavior of the particle system so that it looks like "twinkling stars". Kept the options as the produce some fun firework like effects.
